/**
 * Nova's surfaces (docs/muse/DESIGN.md): a Mac app. The content sits in one rounded
 * `content` window on the `window` ground; the sidebar and inspector float inside it as
 * blurred `glass` panels with a half-pixel `glass-line`; iOS inset grouped lists sit on
 * `group`. Ink comes in three strengths, hairlines are `separator`. The Muse palettes below
 * map the shadcn slots onto these same values, so each color is written once. `background`
 * is the solid surface (shadcn controls paint it inside panels).
 *
 * Owner-approved exceptions to the monochrome rule (Apple Mac-app redesign): the `tint`
 * accent (the one primary action, the selected row, the person's bubble), the colored app
 * `tile-*` gradients, one signature color per section (`sig-*`), the red `alert` badge, the
 * dark `media-*` result tile, and `fork-*` (each side chat (fork) keeps one color in the
 * rail, the transcript and its own view).
 *
 * `ground`, `panel`, `solid`, `line`, `bubble` and `selection` are the older names the
 * screens still read; they now resolve to the window, glass, group, separator and fill.
