 * Charts render both in the browser and, server-side, through resvg — a Rust
 * SVG renderer that resolves no CSS keyword. `system-ui` alone leaves resvg
 * without a family to match, so it draws the shapes and silently skips every
 * glyph. Naming a concrete embedded family first keeps server text visible,
 * while browsers that lack it fall through to their own system font.
