# repro-agent

Reproduce a bug **live in your running Omnigent app** and capture it as a
minimal reliable regression test. Search existing tests and fixtures first;
reuse or extend them when sufficient. Keep e2e coverage for a boundary that
lower-level checks miss. It runs against whatever server you already have (the
server `omnigent run` spins up, or one you pass with `--server`) and authors the
reproduction test into **this** checkout.

## Prerequisites

- A configured Claude provider (`omnigent setup` — an Anthropic API key, a
  Claude subscription, an OpenAI-compatible gateway, or a Databricks workspace).
  The agent's brain runs on the Claude Agent SDK.
- `gh` authenticated (`gh auth login`) if your `bug_url` is a GitHub issue, so
  the agent can read the report.
- Run it **from the root of your `omnigent-ai/omnigent` checkout** so the agent's
  working directory is this repo and it can reuse or extend the appropriate
  existing test suite.
- Optional, for reproduction recordings (skipped gracefully when absent):
  Playwright browsers (`playwright install chromium`) for browser journey
  recordings, [`vhs`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs)
  for CLI-journey tapes, and `ffmpeg` for `.mp4` conversion.

## Usage

```bash
# Against the server `omnigent run` spins up:
omnigent run dev/repro-agent \
  -p '{"bug_url":"https://github.com/omnigent-ai/omnigent/issues/1234"}'

# Against a server you already run:
omnigent run dev/repro-agent --server http://localhost:6767 \
  -p '{"bug_url":"https://linear.app/omnigent/issue/OMNI-1234"}'
```

The `-p` payload is the input contract — just `bug_url`. The agent always
reproduces against the running build (latest `main`), so there's no version to
pass.

### Driver script (isolated worktree)

`dev/repro.py` wraps the above: it prompts for the bug URL (or takes it as an
argument), creates an **isolated git worktree** (`repro/<slug>` branch, off your
current HEAD) so the authored test lands on its own branch without dirtying your
checkout, and runs the agent from there.

```bash
python dev/repro.py                     # prompts for the bug URL
python dev/repro.py https://github.com/omnigent-ai/omnigent/issues/1234
python dev/repro.py OMNI-1234 --server http://localhost:6767
python dev/repro.py <bug_url> --public  # share the session public-read at start
```

`--public` shares the session read-only (anyone who can reach the server) right
after it starts — useful for watching a live run or reproducing against a shared
`--server`. Off by default.

It always keeps the worktree and prints its path + branch at the end; remove it
with `git worktree remove <path>` when done.

## What it does

An automated launcher may optionally supply a report snapshot and a coordinated
planning protocol. In that mode the agent submits a plan, waits for the
coordinator's automatic continuation, and produces a requirement-by-requirement
account alongside its handoff. The coordinator owns record validation and
storage; an independent reviewer still judges the journey and evidence. Normal
invocations below do not pause for registration or require those records.

1. Reconstructs the user journey from the linked bug report.
2. Drives the running app through that journey — Playwright `tests/e2e_ui/` for
   headless web UI runs (including CI), embedded-browser tools for local sessions
   with a connected desktop, and `sys_session_*` / HTTP for backend bugs — until
   it observes the failure. Headless CI does not probe or use desktop browser
   tools, even when they appear in the tool list.
3. Identifies the smallest reliable regression coverage for the observed
   failure: an existing test, a small extension, a focused lower-level check,
   or a necessary e2e. It records the selection rationale and original evidence
   so Resolve can decide which tests ship. Two new test layers are not required.
4. Records each settled facet on its user-facing surface under `recordings/<slug>/`
   — a suitable journey driver with `OMNIGENT_E2E_RECORD_DIR` for web/terminal
   facets, a rendered VHS tape for CLI facets. The driver may be temporary and
   separate from the selected regression test. A reproduced facet is filmed failing (before-fix footage
   the fix step pairs with its after-fix re-recording); an already-fixed facet is
   filmed passing (proof-it-works footage). Best-effort: skipped (and noted) when
   the recorders aren't installed.
5. Checkpoints the machine-readable handoff to
   `.omnigent/repro-handoff.json` as soon as the verdict is known, updating it
   as test and recording evidence lands so an interrupted final response does
   not lose a completed reproduction.
6. Presents a **Steps to reproduce** section with prerequisites, concrete
   numbered actions, exact inputs, relevant waits/reloads, and expected versus
   observed results at the step where each symptom appears. Verified results
   are distinguished from reported or unverified outcomes so a reader can
   repeat the steps manually without opening the test or recording. UI recipes
   use visible controls and plain language; API setup, test selectors, and mock
   details stay in evidence. Manual paths that were not driven are labeled
   unverified.
7. Emits a single fenced ```json block (the machine-readable handoff) whose
   `verdict` is exactly one of `reproduced` / `not_reproduced` / `already_fixed`
   / `needs_more_info`, alongside the per-facet breakdown (each facet stamped
   with its `surface`), test path, recordings list, session id, journey, and
   evidence. The `journey` string preserves the full manual recipe with escaped
   newlines. Parse `verdict` from that block to label the issue.

It does **not** fix the bug, merge, or push — it produces a live-confirmed
reproduction plus the test and hands off. The authored test lands in your working
tree (`git status` to see it).

See `AGENTS.md` for the full operating procedure.
