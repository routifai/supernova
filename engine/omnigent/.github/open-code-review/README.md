# Open Code Review

The `Open Code Review` workflow runs alongside Polly. It posts inline findings
and a fresh summary for each review; low-severity findings go in the summary.
These findings say “Shown here because this finding is low severity.” Actual
inline-posting failures retain their warning and failure reason.
Repeated runs preserve existing threads and avoid posting overlapping inline
comments. It does not approve PRs or request changes.

## Triggers

- Automatically when a same-repository PR is opened, reopened, or marked ready
  for review, matching Polly's lifecycle triggers. Draft and fork PRs are
  skipped. OCR does not automatically run after maintainer approval of a fork PR.
- Comment `/ocr` on its own line. The commenter needs repository write access
  or an entry in the existing `REVIEW_ALLOWLIST` JSON-array repository variable.
  Accepted commands receive an 👀 reaction before entering the review queue.
  A reaction API failure does not prevent the review from starting.
  Authorized commands can still review fork PRs.
- Comment `/ocr force` to rerun a completed review of the same commit.
- Actions → Open Code Review → Run workflow, using the default branch and a PR
  number. The optional `force` checkbox reruns an already-reviewed commit.
  Closed and draft PRs are skipped.

Pushes do not start OCR automatically, matching Polly.
Use `/ocr` to review a new revision.
Only eligible requests enter the per-PR queue, so unrelated comments cannot
cancel or replace an active review.

Before calling the model, OCR checks for a completed review of the current head
SHA. A duplicate request posts at most one skip notice per SHA. Completion
receipts are uploaded only after a complete review of that exact commit, no
finding-filter failures, and successful publication. Only receipts from
successful runs of this workflow count: automatic runs use the trusted base
workflow, and manual runs must use the default branch. Generated comment text
cannot suppress a review. Receipts expire after 90 days (or the
repository's shorter retention limit). Deleting or expiring a receipt makes
the commit eligible for review again.
Failed, partial, skipped, or filter-failed reviews remain retryable with `/ocr`.
A force run still avoids duplicating overlapping inline findings, but always
produces a new summary.

## Configuration

The workflow reuses the `LLM_API_KEY` and `GATEWAY_BASE_URL` repository secrets.
The gateway URL uses the same Anthropic surface as Polly: append `/anthropic`
unless it already ends in `/anthropic`. Authentication uses a bearer token.
The model comes from `OMNIGENT_CI_REVIEW_ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, falling back to
`OMNIGENT_CI_ANTHROPIC_MODEL`. No model identifier or credential is committed.
Requests explicitly enable adaptive thinking with medium reasoning effort;
the upstream action's default of disabled thinking is rejected by our model.

The upstream action is pinned to a commit, the CLI to `1.12.0`, and automatic
CLI updates are disabled. It uses medium effort, concurrency two, a 15-minute
per-task timeout, and a 600,000-token stopping threshold. Final requests can
exceed that threshold. The job has a 30-minute timeout.

`rules.json` includes GitHub automation (including prompts and documentation)
and our Python and frontend tests, while retaining its built-in language rules.
OCR's other file filters and size limits still apply; inspect the coverage artifact.

The workflow's shared `background` instructions review changed code comments:
prefer one line, allow at most three lines per block, and explain the scenario
or reasoning instead of restating code or PR history. Docstrings, API docs,
license headers, generated comments, and required tool directives are exempt.
Violations appear as low-severity findings in the summary and do not block
merging. Keeping this policy in `background` applies it alongside every file's
built-in or custom rule.

OCR `1.12.0` ignores directory-only `.gitignore` exceptions such as `!.github/`.
The root `.gitignore` also includes `!.github/**` so tracked automation reaches
OCR's file selection. Generated-file exclusions follow that exception, and
hidden directories inside `.github` remain ignored. Keep this ordering when
editing the ignore rules.

The workflow runs from trusted base/default-branch context. The upstream
action reads the PR head through Git objects and does not run PR-authored code
or install the PR's dependencies. Automatic reviews use `pull_request_target`
for trusted workflow configuration and accept only same-repository PRs. Fork
PRs require an authorized `/ocr` command or manual workflow dispatch.

Upstream artifact uploads are disabled. The workflow uploads separate copies
of the result JSON and stderr with gateway credentials, URL, and origin
redacted, including their JSON-escaped forms. Diagnostics expire after seven
days. Detecting the gateway key fails the job and prevents recording completion;
only sanitized copies are uploaded. This check protects diagnostic artifacts;
the upstream action publishes PR comments before it runs.

## Verify after merging

To check comment quality, use a PR that adds a four-line comment block, a comment
that merely restates code, a useful one-line comment, a useful three-line
explanation, and a longer docstring. Run `/ocr force` and inspect the summary:
only the first two should receive comment-quality findings. This is a model
review; local workflow tests do not establish its detection accuracy.

1. Open a non-draft, same-repository PR and confirm OCR starts without a
   command. Open a fork PR and confirm OCR skips it; reopening or marking it
   ready must also skip it. Open a draft and confirm no review starts until it is
   marked ready for review. Reopen an already-reviewed PR and confirm OCR skips
   the completed commit. Push a new commit and confirm OCR does not start.
   For a manual run, use
   `gh workflow run open-code-review.yml --repo omnigent-ai/omnigent -f pr=7878`
   for an open, non-draft PR, or comment `/ocr` on one.
   For comment triggers, confirm the bot adds 👀 after authorization.
2. Use a PR with changed Python or frontend tests. Open the Actions run and
   confirm the action checks out the trusted default branch and loads
   `.github/open-code-review/rules.json` without an unreadable-rule error.
   Download `ocr-review-result-<run-id>-<attempt>` and check that the manifest's
   `input.resolved_head` matches the requested SHA and coverage includes those
   test files.
3. Confirm the PR receives a summary and any inline findings. Verify the action
   produces `comments_failed=0` and a nonempty `summary_comment_url`, the result
   status is `complete`, and `ocr-completed-<pr>-<sha>` contains the matching
   PR, head, and summary URL. This receipt step is gated on those outputs.
   Rerun `/ocr`: the model step should be skipped and one skip notice should
   link to the prior successful run. Repeat `/ocr` to confirm it does not post
   another skip notice.
4. Comment `/ocr force`: confirm a new review and summary, without duplicating
   overlapping inline comments. Push a commit and confirm plain `/ocr` reviews it.
5. Inspect the downloaded diagnostic copies for redaction. Never put real
   secrets in PR content to test this; the local tests use synthetic credentials.
6. For a run with a finding-filter error (`Review filter: failed` or
   `Review filter failed` in stderr), confirm a warning and a note appear in
   the Actions summary. There must be no completion receipt for that run,
   and plain `/ocr` must retry it. Validate any retained findings manually.
   Incomplete results must fail the completeness step; publication failures
   must also prevent a receipt. If these failures do not occur during the
   smoke test, record those live scenarios as unverified; local fixture tests
   cover them without deliberately disrupting the shared gateway.

Adding this workflow in a branch does not activate the default-branch triggers.
No GitHub run or comment is needed to validate it locally:

```bash
actionlint .github/workflows/open-code-review.yml
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/scripts -p test_open_code_review_workflow.py
```

With OCR CLI `1.12.0` installed, verify rule loading without calling the model:

```bash
OCR_NO_UPDATE=1 ocr review --from <base-sha> --to <head-sha> \
  --rule .github/open-code-review/rules.json --preview
```

Choose a diff containing Python or frontend tests and confirm they appear in
the preview's review list. Also verify a diff under `.github` includes workflow
YAML, Python code, tests, and prompt text rather than reporting no selected files.
