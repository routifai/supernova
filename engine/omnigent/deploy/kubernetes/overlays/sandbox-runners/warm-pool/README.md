# Native agent-sandbox warm pools

Warm pools prepare spare Pods before a session needs them. Omnigent claims a
compatible Sandbox, delivers its managed-host identity to the waiting bootstrap,
and starts repository preparation and the normal host. GitHub and Databricks
credentials still come from the existing owner-bound broker and credential store.

To reduce repository preparation after a claim, admins can also configure
[`sandbox.git_clone`](../../../../../docs/extending/sandbox_providers.md#faster-initial-git-clones).
Clone depth and branch selection apply to fresh checkouts without requiring a
different pool template or prepared repository image.

This is opt-in for `provider: agent_sandbox`. An explicitly shared pool can serve
different agents and harnesses that use the same infrastructure profile. The
existing direct Sandbox path supports deployments without a pool and requests
whose trusted agent classifier differs from a dedicated pool's classifier.
Other profile mismatches fail explicitly so an incompatible template cannot
serve the session.

## Configure a deployment

Install the upstream v1.0.0 controller with extensions in your chosen cluster:

```bash
kubectl --context YOUR_CONTEXT apply --server-side -f \
  https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/releases/download/v1.0.0/sandbox-with-extensions.yaml
```

Build the host image from the same Omnigent revision as the server; it must
contain the warm bootstrap module. Set the image and the other desired settings
in your server config, then add the pool reference:

```yaml
sandbox:
  provider: agent_sandbox
  server_url: http://omnigent.omnigent.svc.cluster.local:8000
  agent_sandbox:
    warm_pool: omnigent-default-v1
  kubernetes:
    namespace: omnigent-sandboxes
    service_account: omnigent-runner
    image: your-registry/omnigent-host:your-version
```

Generate the template and pool from that exact config. `--shared` is recommended
for deployments using the owner-bound credential brokers: built-in and uploaded
agents can use the same spare inventory. Use the same workspace volume
environment settings for generation and for the server:

```bash
export OMNIGENT_AGENT_SANDBOX_WORKSPACE_SIZE=5Gi
python -m omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.agent_sandbox_warm_pool \
  --config server-config.yaml --name omnigent-default-v1 --replicas 2 --shared \
  > warm-pool.yaml
kubectl --context YOUR_CONTEXT apply -f warm-pool.yaml
kubectl --context YOUR_CONTEXT apply -k deploy/kubernetes/overlays/sandbox-runners/warm-pool
```

Apply this additive RBAC overlay alongside the existing sandbox-runners
deployment. It grants the server ServiceAccount claim create/get/patch/delete,
template/pool get, and `pods/exec` create/get in `omnigent-sandboxes`. The
application does not create or modify operator-owned pools. Kubernetes RBAC cannot
restrict exec to a particular command; enabling warm mode expands the server's
permissions within the runner namespace. Direct mode does not need this overlay.

New claims carry a temporary deletion deadline while allocation is in progress.
After registering the owner-bound host, Omnigent clears that claim deadline and
uses the Sandbox inactivity deadline. The claim patch permission supports this
handoff and prevents abandoned launches from retaining allocated resources.

Pool profiles include the image, resources, mounts, scheduling, security
settings, and allocation mode. Choose the mode when generating the template:

| Generator option | Agent compatibility |
| --- | --- |
| `--shared` | Any session harness or trusted agent classifier, including uploaded agents, with the same infrastructure profile. |
| `--agent-name NAME` | The exact built-in agent classifier; other classifiers use direct provisioning. |
| Neither option | Legacy unclassified behavior: only an exact empty-classifier match uses the pool; built-in classifiers use direct provisioning. |

`--shared` and `--agent-name` are mutually exclusive. A shared Pod template omits
`omnigent.ai/agent` and carries the annotation
`omnigent.ai/warm-pool-shared: "true"`; the shared marker is part of its profile
fingerprint. An absent agent label alone does not make an existing pool shared.
The host image must still support the requested harness. Use a new versioned
pool name when changing modes or other profile settings so old spare Pods do
not serve the previous profile.

Per-agent admission-time credential injection does not apply to an unlabeled
shared pool. Do not relabel allocated Pods to trigger it: admission already ran
when the Pod was created. Use `--agent-name NAME` for deployments that rely on
that agent-specific admission behavior. Shared mode changes pool compatibility;
GitHub and Databricks credentials remain scoped to the managed host's owner by
the existing broker.

### Initial-release constraint: allocated profiles stay fixed

An allocated warm Sandbox retains its original static infrastructure profile.
Changing the server's image, mounts, resources, scheduling, or security settings
can prevent that existing session from waking. Shared allocations allow agent
or harness changes across suspension when those infrastructure settings still
match.

Dedicated and legacy unclassified allocations also retain their exact agent
classifier. Switching an agent can remove its built-in classification and
prevent a later wake. A mismatch fails with a profile error and preserves the
Sandbox/PVC; Omnigent does not relabel the retained allocation or change its
admission identity to fit the new session configuration.

Changing `sandbox.agent_sandbox.warm_pool` selects a pool for new allocations
only. It does not migrate existing claims or their workspaces. The generator's
`Recreate` strategy replaces unused pool inventory only. Use direct provisioning
for new sessions that need infrastructure changes across wake. For classifier
changes alone, use an explicitly shared pool from the first allocation.
Disabling pooling does not convert existing warm allocations into direct ones.

The bootstrap and host are both regular containers, and each reserves the
configured resources. Kubernetes sums their requests: `250m` CPU and `384Mi`
memory in the config means `500m` and `768Mi` per pooled Pod, before injected
sidecars. Account for both spare and allocated Pods when sizing node capacity.

Generated templates set `networkPolicyManagement: Unmanaged` and use cluster
DNS, preserving the existing direct provider's networking model. Operators must
provide the production NetworkPolicies, including DNS and callback access to
Omnigent and any private Git/Databricks endpoints. The template does not install
a default isolation policy.

Do not add environment variables or PVC overrides to individual claims: upstream
creates a cold Sandbox for those overrides. Session-specific launch data arrives
after allocation. Each template-created HOME PVC belongs to its Sandbox and
remains with it through suspension. Inactivity deadlines belong on the Sandbox;
claim lifecycle expiry deletes backing resources and must not be used for idle
suspension. Allocated Sandboxes are not returned to the spare pool.

## Verify a deployment

The opt-in live E2E test exercises the configured provider and native controllers.
Use a test server that accepts API requests without an authentication header,
such as a single-user development server. Configure it with an explicitly shared
pool and wait for at least one ready spare. Its namespace and pool
must be isolated from other test launchers so the test can identify its claim.
The host image must support the Claude SDK harness used by the test bundle.

Set the server address and Kubernetes connection explicitly:

```bash
OMNIGENT_WARM_POOL_E2E=1 \
  OMNIGENT_WARM_POOL_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
  OMNIGENT_WARM_POOL_KUBECONFIG=/absolute/path/to/test-kubeconfig \
  OMNIGENT_WARM_POOL_CONTEXT=YOUR_TEST_CONTEXT \
  OMNIGENT_WARM_POOL_NAMESPACE=omnigent-sandboxes \
  OMNIGENT_WARM_POOL_NAME=omnigent-default-v1 \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_agent_sandbox_warm_pool.py -v
```

The test records Pod UIDs before creating an empty managed session. It verifies
that the allocated Pod already existed, waits for host and runner registration,
writes and reads a workspace marker, and checks that spare capacity replenishes.
It then adds slow shell initialization to the retained HOME, suspends the
Sandbox, and wakes it through the session API. The host, claim, Sandbox, PVC,
and workspace marker must survive while the Pod UID changes and readiness
recovers. It deletes its session afterward. No model request or connected-account
credentials are required; without the explicit opt-in flag, the test skips.

Validate credential and lifecycle behavior separately in an authenticated test
deployment. Connect test GitHub and Databricks accounts, create a pooled session
with a private repository, and check `git fetch` and `gh api user --jq .login`.
For Databricks, make a small gateway request through a command-based Codex,
Claude, or Pi harness using the connected workspace. The host's token-free
Databricks profile supports those broker-backed gateway commands; the standalone
Databricks CLI and MCP resolver still need their own supported authentication.
Keep static provider credential Secrets out of the pool during broker validation
so they cannot hide a failed connection lookup.
Verify that the same workspace survives suspension and wake, and that both
services still authenticate after activation refresh. Check account separation
with two authenticated users and verify that disconnecting a service stops new
broker requests from authenticating through that connection.

For built-in agents, use `--shared` or a dedicated pool with the matching
`--agent-name`; an unmarked unclassified pool selects direct provisioning for
those agents. Confirm the claim and pre-request Pod UID for every timing
measurement. A successful allocation alone
does not distinguish a warm hit from upstream cold creation. Measure image
preparation separately from workspace preparation, broker setup, host/runner
registration, and the first model response.
