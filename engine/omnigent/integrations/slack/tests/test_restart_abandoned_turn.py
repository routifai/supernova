"""A bot restart mid-turn must not leave a Slack thread misleadingly stuck.

A bot restart (deploy, crash, rollout) runs ``SlackOmnigentService.shutdown()``
— the teardown ``app.run``'s finally invokes — which cancels every in-flight
turn task. A thread whose turn was mid-flight must not be left in a permanently
misleading state:

1. the "_Working on it…_" ack placeholder must be deleted, edited, or followed
   by an honest notice — never left as the thread's permanent last word; and
2. the thread→session record survives the restart (SQLite) while the server
   still reports the abandoned turn's session as ``running`` (shutdown only
   severed the bot's own stream reader, not the server-side turn), so a
   follow-up message in the same thread must not be deflected with "I'm still
   working on your previous message … send this again once I've replied" — a
   reply the restarted bot is no longer listening for and will never deliver.
   It gets an honest "your previous message died with my restart" notice
   instead. The follow-up must also NOT be run into the still-busy session:
   the marker cannot prove the running response is the abandoned Slack turn
   (a cancel before submission strands the marker, and the owner may have
   started a web-UI turn after the restart), and attaching a Slack renderer
   to the session-wide event stream would replay another surface's in-flight
   output into the channel.

Both tests assert the DESIRED user-visible behavior, so they fail on the buggy
build and become the regression guard once the fix lands.

Same harness as ``test_service.py`` / ``test_integration.py``: the real
service + real ``SQLiteStore``, a recording Slack client from ``fakes``, and
an in-file Omnigent client whose turn hangs mid-flight (the moment a restart
interrupts).
