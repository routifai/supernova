"""Regression tests for ``DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}`` session cleanup.

Covers two independent problems:

#1350 — native bridge dirs leak on session delete.
Each native session's bridge dir holds a per-conversation bridge token + MCP
config (secret material). ``DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}`` closes the pane but
historically never removed this SEPARATE dir, so token-bearing
``/tmp/omnigent-*`` (and ``~/.omnigent``) dirs accumulated even on a clean
delete. The delete path must now ``rmtree`` it — for ALL 11 native families,
not just the original 5.

#3728 — spec-fill generation guard prevents ABA cache repopulation.
Session ids are caller-supplied and can be reused.  A spec fill parked across
``delete_session`` + same-id recreate must NOT write its stale result into the
new session's cache.  ``_session_cache_generations`` is incremented (never
popped) on every delete so that a fill that captured generation N before the
delete is rejected by the N+1 current value.
