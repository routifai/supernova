"""Daytona egress relay must keep the base path of a prefixed ``UPSTREAM_URL``.

The Cloudflare Worker in ``deploy/daytona`` reverse-proxies every request a
Daytona sandbox makes (host dial-back HTTP + tunnel upgrades) to the real
Omnigent server. Deployments that mount the server under a URL prefix
(e.g. ``https://example.com/omnigent``) deploy the relay with
``UPSTREAM_URL=https://example.com/omnigent``. A transparent relay must
forward an incoming path *under* that prefix (relay ``/health`` -> upstream
``/omnigent/health``); dropping the prefix 404s every dial-back request, so a
managed host can never come online.

Runs the real Worker module under Node's web-standard runtime — the same
``fetch(request, env)`` entrypoint Cloudflare invokes — in front of a local
upstream that records the paths it receives. Requires Node.js but no external
services or credentials, so it runs in the default pytest suite.
