"""End-to-end repro: `omnigent start` against an unreachable configured server.

With `server: http://127.0.0.1:<port>` configured and nothing listening
there, `omnigent start --non-interactive` prints nothing at all while the
host daemon retries the connection, then fails ~35s later with a generic
"did not register within 30s" error that never names the server it tried
or the connection refusal, followed by a stale-host HTTP 401 hint that
cannot apply to a connection-refused failure.

This drives the real user journey: the actual `omnigent start
--non-interactive` process with the unreachable server in config, reading
its output live with per-line timestamps.

Run with::

    python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_start_unreachable_server_feedback_e2e.py -v
