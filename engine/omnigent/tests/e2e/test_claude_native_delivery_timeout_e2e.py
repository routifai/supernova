"""E2E regression: claude-native message delivery survives a transiently
unresponsive Claude Code TUI.

The failure mode this guards: a user sends a message from the Omnigent web
chat to a ``claude-native`` session; the bridge pastes the draft into Claude
Code's TUI input box and the draft visibly commits, but the TUI is
unresponsive at submit time (a CPU-starved host, a paste-coalescing burst) and
does not process the submit ``Enter`` for tens of seconds. The bridge used to
give up after a fixed 10s window and raise "The message was not delivered";
``ClaudeNativeExecutor.run_turn`` then logged ``claude-native: failed to
deliver message to harness`` and yielded an ``ExecutorError``, which the
runner surfaced to the web UI as a failed turn -- even though the committed
draft would have delivered moments later once the TUI caught up.

This test drives the REAL transport end to end: a real ``tmux`` server on a
private socket advertised through the production ``write_tmux_target``, and a
fake Claude TUI that renders the framed chat composer, visibly commits the
pasted draft, then STALLS (stops reading stdin, queueing input in the pty)
well past the legacy 10s give-up before recovering and processing the queued
submit. Delivery must succeed:

- ``inject_user_message`` -- the public bridge delivery call -- returns
  instead of raising the delivery-timeout ``RuntimeError``.
- ``ClaudeNativeExecutor.run_turn`` yields ``TurnComplete`` -- not the
  ``ExecutorError`` failed turn -- and never logs the delivery failure.

Runs with no LLM, no ``claude`` binary and no server -- only ``tmux``::
