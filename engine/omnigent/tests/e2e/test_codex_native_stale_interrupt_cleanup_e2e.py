"""Regression e2e: codex-native abnormal-exit interrupt with a stale turn id.

Journey (all through real product code): a web user message starts native
Codex turn 1 (``turn/start``; the bridge records it as active). Codex then
moves on to its own next turn - the user drives the embedded Codex TUI pane
directly, or Codex starts an internal follow-on turn - while Omnigent's
bridge state still records turn 1. The next web message dies abnormally on an
unrelated app-server rejection, which leaves the stale turn id recorded, so
the adapter's abnormal-exit cleanup interrupts the abandoned inner session
with it. The app-server rejects that with its JSON-RPC ``-32600`` mismatch
(``expected active turn id turn_1 but found turn_2``) and ``_safe_interrupt``
logs the ERROR::

    abnormal-exit interrupt of inner session <key> failed or timed out

with a ``CodexAppServerResponseError`` traceback.

The test drives the REAL ``ExecutorAdapter`` -> ``CodexNativeExecutor`` ->
``CodexAppServerClient`` stack over a real loopback WebSocket. Only the
upstream ``codex app-server`` wire peer is faked, because the real Codex CLI
requires an authenticated account to run turns (unavailable in CI) and the
staleness window is a nondeterministic race against a live TUI. The fake
implements only the app-server's documented turn bookkeeping: assign turn ids
on ``turn/start`` and reject a ``turn/steer``/``turn/interrupt`` whose turn id
does not match the active turn with the production ``-32600`` error message.

The assertions state the *correct* post-fix contract, so the test FAILS on
the buggy build (reproducing the failure) and PASSES once the abnormal-exit
cleanup tolerates Codex having moved past the bridge-recorded turn - the
recorded turn is no longer active, so there is nothing left for the cleanup
to interrupt, that expected condition must not surface as the ERROR-level
failure signature, and the stale record must be dropped.
