"""Codex native app-server event-stream disconnect e2e tests.

User journey: a native Codex session listens for app-server events —
the forwarder's event loop and thread-startup discovery both iterate
``CodexAppServerClient.iter_events()`` — and the app-server connection
goes away: a clean close, an error close, an abrupt transport drop, or
a malformed frame that kills the client's reader. Pending RPCs already
fail promptly; the waiting event consumers must also wake promptly
(terminate or receive a disconnect error) instead of waiting forever
for events that can no longer arrive. Notifications buffered before
the disconnect must still be delivered, and consumers must likewise
wake when the client itself is closed.

The app-server side is a controlled loopback WebSocket server that
completes the real initialize handshake, so the real
``CodexAppServerClient`` event path runs end to end.

Usage::
