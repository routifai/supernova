"""Cross-harness ``harness_override`` must not be ignored on ``initial_items``.

User journey (from the ticket's Steps to reproduce):

1. An agent pinned to the ``claude-sdk`` harness exists.
2. ``POST /v1/sessions`` with ``harness_override="codex-native"`` AND one
   ``initial_items`` user message (the kickoff).
3. A runner binds (the external-host launch analog: ``PATCH`` ``runner_id``)
   and the automatic kickoff turn fires.
4. Observed failure: the kickoff executes on the agent spec's **claude-sdk**
   brain, not the overridden **codex-native** harness.
5. A later message posted through the standard events route must also stay
   on the override: the native forward carries the override as session
   state, and a runner that resolves a turn from the spec alone evicts the
   override harness mid-session (the split-brain between turns).

The test boots a real ``omnigent server`` + external runner + the mock LLM
(``tests/server/integration/mock_llm_server.py``) as subprocesses, drives the
journey over HTTP, and asserts the kickoff never reaches the spec's claude
brain. While the bug is live this fails: the mock records Anthropic-model
requests for the kickoff and the assistant answer carries the claude
fallback marker.

Run directly (excluded from the default run like the rest of ``tests/e2e``)::
