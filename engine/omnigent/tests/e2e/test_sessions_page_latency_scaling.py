"""E2E: the session-list page read must not slow down with total session count.

Reproduces the sidebar session-list slowdown: a 20-row ``GET /v1/sessions``
page — the read behind the web sidebar — takes time
proportional to the user's TOTAL session count, not the page size. Measured on
loopback SQLite: ~4 ms on an empty DB, ~40 ms at 5k sessions, ~240 ms at 20k,
~1 s at 100k. The store's ``list_conversations`` prefetches every
permission-qualifying conversation id for the user and binds each one into an
``IN (...)`` filter, so every page pays an O(total-sessions) fetch + bind.

The test boots two real ``omni server`` subprocesses (no runner, no LLM) via
the benchmark harness, one against a small seeded corpus and one against a
16x larger one, and times the same 20-row page read against each. A paged,
index-backed read costs roughly the same at both sizes (ratio ~1x); the O(N)
prefetch makes the large corpus several times slower (~10x observed). The
ratio assertion is machine-speed independent, so it fails specifically on the
scaling defect and passes once the ACL filter is pushed down into the query.

Run it directly (no LLM key needed)::

    uv run --no-sync pytest tests/e2e/test_sessions_page_latency_scaling.py -v
