"""Model-override probe — is a caller-specified model honored?

This probe first checks that the profile model passes Omnigent's override
validation and family gate — the same checks the server applies before
spawn. The live half runs only when the driver reports that it actually
applied that model as an override. A completing turn then proves the id
threaded through to a real gateway route rather than being dropped.

A transport that never sends the model (native-TUI creates the session
without one) returns ``SKIPPED``. Turn completion alone is not evidence.

Limitation (documented for the next iteration): a completed turn on a
transport that *did* apply the id proves the id was *accepted and
routable*, not that a different id would have routed differently. The
stronger contrast probe — a family-valid but nonexistent id must FAIL
while the real id SUCCEEDS — is a phase-2 follow-up; it costs a second
(deliberately failing) turn and needs the gateway to reject unknown ids
promptly.
