"""Tests for the managed-path sandbox keepalive.

Covers the resolution chain (runner -> session -> host -> provider), the
per-runner rate limit, and the two skip paths (provider can't extend, host has
no sandbox). Stubs stand in for the stores/deployment: the module only reads a
few attributes off each, so a real store would add setup without adding cover.
