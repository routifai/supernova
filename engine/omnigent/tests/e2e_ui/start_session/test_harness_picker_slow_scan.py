"""E2E: the landing harness picker must not be hostage to a slow sessions scan.

The new-chat landing composer's agent/harness picker is fed by
``useAvailableAgents`` (``web/src/hooks/useAvailableAgents.ts``), which awaits
``Promise.all([GET /v1/agents, GET /v1/sessions?limit=100&visibility=mine&…]])`` before
returning ANY rows. The harness rows (Claude Code, Codex, …) come entirely from
the ``/v1/agents`` catalog, yet they cannot render until the sessions discovery
scan also resolves — so on a deployment where that scan is slow (managed
servers with large session tables), the picker sits disabled reading
"No agents" for the whole scan latency even though the catalog answered
immediately. Users see "harnesses slow to show up" in the new-session composer.

This test reproduces that hostage-taking deterministically: the catalog and
hosts endpoints are stubbed to answer instantly while the discovery scan is
delayed by ``_SCAN_DELAY_S`` (standing in for managed session-list latency),
and the test asserts the picker offers the harnesses within
``_PICKER_BUDGET_S`` — well under the injected delay. While the picker is
gated on the scan, the harnesses only appear after ``_SCAN_DELAY_S`` and the
assertion fails; once the picker renders catalog rows without waiting for the
discovery extension, it passes.

The stubbing shape (hosts/agents faked, ``visibility=mine`` scan intercepted) and the
async-in-a-fresh-thread drive mirror ``test_start_session.py`` /
``test_harness_install.py`` — see those modules for why the e2e harness needs
the stub host and the fresh event loop.
