"""E2E: macOS Cmd line-editing shortcuts in the session terminal.

On macOS the standard readline-style Cmd shortcuts in a session's terminal
did nothing useful:

- **Cmd+Backspace** should kill to the start of the line (Ctrl-U, ``0x15``),
- **Cmd+Left** should move the cursor to the start of the line (Ctrl-A,
  ``0x01``),
- **Cmd+Right** should move the cursor to the end of the line (Ctrl-E,
  ``0x05``),

because ``terminalKeyEventPayload`` (``web/src/components/blocks/
TerminalSession.ts``) used to map only Shift+Enter, and xterm.js has no
default binding for ``metaKey`` combos: Cmd+Left/Right produced no bytes at
all, and Cmd+Backspace fell through to a plain single-char DEL. The Option
(Alt) equivalents always worked because xterm encodes Alt-modified keys as
ESC-prefixed sequences.

Each test drives the real journey: open a shell from the workspace rail's
"+" menu, type a command line, press the Cmd shortcut, and finish the line so
that the *shell's own line editing* proves where the cursor was. The typed
line is arranged so the command only produces its file side-effect when the
shortcut performed its readline operation — e.g. for Cmd+Backspace the test
types a poison prefix, presses Cmd+Backspace (which must kill the whole
line), then types ``touch <file>``; on the buggy build the poison prefix
survives, the garbled line runs as an ``echo``/not-found, and the file never
appears. xterm renders to a canvas (stdout is not in the DOM), so the file
side-effect plus the bytes observed on the terminal-attach WebSocket are the
machine-checkable signals.

A readiness handshake (a ``touch`` that must land before the scenario) makes
sure the PTY's shell is accepting and executing input before any Cmd keys are
sent, so the assertions can only fail on the shortcut behavior itself.

All three tests use the function-scoped ``terminal_session`` fixture (the
``zsh``-declaring agent, runner-bound session); the launched shell is
actually ``bash --noprofile --norc``, whose default emacs bindings implement
Ctrl-A / Ctrl-E / Ctrl-U — exactly what the fix is expected to send.
