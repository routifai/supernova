r"""UI journeys: native Claude Code parity with its TUI, and delivery into it.

The native ``claude-native`` ("Claude Code") wrapper is terminal-first: a real
``claude`` CLI runs in the session terminal, the SPA's **Terminal** view
attaches to that live TUI over a WebSocket, and the SPA's **Chat** view renders
the SAME canonical transcript (``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/items``) the TUI prints.
A native bridge forwards web-composer messages INTO the Claude process and
forwards Claude's transcript back OUT as conversation items. This suite asserts
that round-trips both ways and renders exactly once — the three properties the
native forwarder has historically regressed on.

The LLM calls are served by the in-process mock LLM server rather than a real
Anthropic endpoint. Before each test run a mock ``anthropic`` provider config is
written to ``~/.omnigent/config.yaml`` (see ``native_claude_mock_session`` in
``conftest.py``), redirecting the runner's ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` to the mock
server. Each tested turn installs its expected token as the fallback response,
so Claude's private background requests cannot drain later turns from a queue.

The second journey covers the IN direction under the condition that broke it:
a person leaves the TUI composer occupied from the embedded terminal (a ctrl+r
history search, ``!`` shell mode, the double-Escape rewind dialog) and then
sends from the web composer. Those keystrokes go through the real xterm, so the
pane genuinely is in that state when the message is injected.
