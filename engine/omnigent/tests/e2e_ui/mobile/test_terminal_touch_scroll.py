"""E2E: the terminal view's scrollback is unreachable by touch on mobile.

Regression test: on a phone, touch-dragging in a terminal pane must move
the scrollback — without a touch input path the view stays pinned to the
live bottom, so output that has scrolled off is unreachable. Mouse-wheel
scrolling in the same pane works on desktop, so a failure here is
specifically the touch input path, not missing scrollback data.

Journey (mirrors the report's steps, driven with real browser touch input):

1. On a phone-profile browser (mobile viewport, ``has_touch``), open a
   session whose agent declares shell access.
2. Open a terminal pane (kebab → Shells → "New shell" — the mobile create
   entry point) and run a command that prints more lines than fit on one
   screen, filling xterm's scrollback.
3. Sanity: wheel scrolling moves the scrollback (proves the buffer is there
   and scrollable — the desktop path that works).
4. Finger-swipe downward on the terminal output (the "scroll back" gesture)
   using CDP ``Input.dispatchTouchEvent``, which goes through the browser's
   real input pipeline — native touch scrolling and JS touch handlers alike
   would both move the view.
5. Assert the scroll position moved back toward older output.

Observable: xterm v6 renders scroll state through a VS Code-style custom
``.xterm-scrollable-element`` — its vertical scrollbar ``.slider``'s ``top``
tracks the viewport position (the native ``.xterm-viewport`` element's
``scrollTop`` stays 0). "Pinned to the live bottom" = slider at its maximum
top; "scrolled back" = slider top decreased.

On the unfixed build step 5 fails: ``TerminalSession.ts`` wires only
``attachCustomWheelEventHandler`` (wheel events), no touch handler exists,
and the xterm mount sits under ``overflow-hidden`` wrappers with the
``.xterm-screen`` hit target being a *sibling* of the scroll machinery — so
a finger drag has nowhere to go and the slider never moves. After a fix (a
touch handler driving ``term.scrollLines()``, or CSS routing touch pans into
the scrollable element) the swipe moves the view and the test passes.
