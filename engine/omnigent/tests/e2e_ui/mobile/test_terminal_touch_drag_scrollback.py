"""Mobile: touch-dragging the terminal view must scroll back through scrollback.

On a phone, the terminal session view cannot be scrolled back with a finger:
touch-dragging over the xterm pane does nothing and the view stays pinned to
the live bottom, so output that has scrolled off screen is unreachable. A
mouse wheel over the same pane scrolls fine, so the scrollback exists
client-side (xterm is configured with a 20k-line buffer) — the gap is input
plumbing: ``TerminalSession.ts`` wires an explicitly mouse-only custom wheel
handler and nothing routes touch into xterm's scrollback, while
``TerminalView.tsx`` mounts xterm under ``overflow-hidden`` wrappers, which
also rules out the browser's native touch scrolling.

Journey (from the bug report, driven on the web lane at a touch phone
profile — the iOS/Android apps are thin native shells over this same SPA):

1. open a session whose agent declares shell access, on a touch phone viewport
2. header kebab → Shells → "New shell" — a real PTY opens as the main view
3. run a command that prints more output than fits on one screen
4. sanity: a mouse-wheel scroll moves the scrollback (it exists and works)
5. touch-drag down on the terminal → the scrollback must move too

The last assertion is the regression guard: on the buggy build a trusted
touch drag leaves the terminal pinned at the bottom while the same pane
scrolls freely under the wheel.

Scroll position is observed through the vertical scrollbar's slider inside
xterm's ``.xterm-scrollable-element`` (xterm v6 renders its own scrollbar;
the legacy ``.xterm-viewport`` no longer carries a native scroll range).
The slider's ``top`` falls as the view scrolls back and its height shrinks
as the buffer grows, so it mirrors both scrollback existence and position.

The drag is injected with CDP ``Input.dispatchTouchEvent`` (trusted,
compositor-level touch — what Chromium's device emulation produces), not
synthesized JS ``TouchEvent``s: untrusted events can never drive native
scrolling, and the guard must hold whichever way the fix lands (a JS touch
handler or permissive ``overflow``/``touch-action`` CSS).
