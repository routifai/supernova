"""E2E: harness readiness on a credential-less host.

Journey from the bug report: self-host ``omnigent host`` from an environment
whose image ships the harness CLIs but has **no** credentials configured, then
open the new-session picker against that host. The daemon's readiness map
(``configured_harnesses`` in its hello frame) drives the picker's warnings.

Unlike the stubbed availability tests in this directory, these tests register a
REAL ``omnigent host`` daemon (isolated ``HOME``, no provider keys or CLI
logins) against the live e2e server, so the daemon's actual readiness map — not
a hand-written wire body — is what the picker renders.

* ``test_sdk_harness_readiness_reflects_missing_credentials`` is the
  regression test for the headline facet: the daemon used to report the
  in-process SDK harnesses (``claude-sdk`` / ``openai-agents``) as ready no
  matter what, so the picker showed no warning and the failure only surfaced
  when the first turn died with an auth error. It fails whenever readiness for
  SDK harnesses claims ``true`` on a host with no resolvable credential.
* ``test_cli_harness_readiness_warns_without_credentials`` guards the already
  fixed facets of the same report on the real daemon path: ``pi`` reports
  ``needs-auth`` (not available) when its binary is present but no credential
  is configured, the picker warns for it, and ``claude-native`` is a readiness
  entry distinct from ``claude-sdk``.

SDK-harness ``needs-auth`` is advisory: the daemon cannot see agent-level
credentials (``executor.auth``) and never blocks an SDK launch, so the picker
keeps the row selectable and warns via the under-composer notice. The SDK test
therefore drives the normal picker path (click the row, observe the notice,
launch). CLI-backed harnesses (pi) keep #7882's blocking treatment — their row
is disabled with a warning badge — so the pi test seeds the persisted last pick
(``omnigent:last-agent-id``) to keep the launch journey drivable.

The async-in-a-fresh-thread shape is inherited from
``start_session/test_start_session.py``: once a pytest-playwright sync test has
run in the session, pytest-asyncio can't start a loop on the main thread.
