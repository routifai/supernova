"""Devin lifecycle-hook entrypoint for the devin-native harness.

Devin runs a configured hook as a subprocess per event, hands it the event JSON
on stdin, and reads a JSON verdict from stdout (exit 2 also blocks). This module
is that subprocess. It has three jobs:

#. **Record.** Every event is appended to the bridge's ``hooks.jsonl`` so
   :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.devin_native.forwarder` can mirror the conversation into
   Omnigent. This happens first and unconditionally — a policy or network
   failure must not cost us the transcript.

#. **Enforce Omnigent policy.** ``UserPromptSubmit`` (request phase),
   ``PreToolUse`` (tool-call phase) and ``PostToolUse`` (tool-result phase) are
   POSTed to ``/v1/sessions/{id}/policies/evaluate``. The shared
   :mod:`omnigent.native.native_policy_hook` seam owns the request/response
   translation, including the fail-closed defaults, so devin behaves exactly
   like claude-native and codex-native here. An ASK verdict is resolved
   server-side (the POST parks until a human answers) and comes back as a hard
   ALLOW/DENY.

#. **Mirror Devin's own consent prompt.** ``PermissionRequest`` fires when Devin
   would show its TUI approval prompt. Rather than stranding that prompt in a
   pane the web user may not be looking at, it is republished as an Omnigent
   elicitation and the user's answer is relayed back.

Kept deliberately import-light: it runs on every tool call, so it must not pull
in the runner or server stacks.
