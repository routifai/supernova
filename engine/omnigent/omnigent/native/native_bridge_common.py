"""Shared owner-pid marker + orphan prune for native-harness bridge dirs.

Each native coding-agent harness (claude / codex / antigravity / opencode /
pi) keeps a per-session bridge directory under its own bridge root holding the
``bridge.json`` token, MCP/policy config, and hook state. Some harnesses also
co-locate persistent resume state there. When a launcher crashes or a session
is abandoned, disposable bridge material must be reclaimed without deleting
state the native runtime needs to resume.

Every bridge dir carries an ``owner.pid`` marker naming the process that
prepared it. The marker is refreshed on every turn's bridge prep. The sweep
considers dirs whose owner is provably dead while leaving live and unmarked
dirs alone; harnesses may apply an additional retention policy.

This module factors the marker write and the per-root sweep so all five
harnesses share one implementation (the per-harness modules only supply their
own bridge root), plus a dynamic cross-harness reaper for host maintenance or
standalone runner startup. It mirrors the terminal orphan sweep
(``inner/terminal.py:reap_orphaned_terminals``) and reuses that module's
canonical process-liveness predicate.

    Remove per-session bridge dirs under *bridge_root* whose owner is dead.

    The in-run analog of the terminal/process orphan sweeps: scans
    *bridge_root* and removes each immediate child dir whose ``owner.pid``
    marker names a process that no longer exists. A harness may provide an
    additional eligibility predicate, such as a minimum inactivity period.
    Conservative in the dangerous direction — a reused/foreign pid reads as
    alive and is left.
    Cleanup holds the bridge directory's stable lock while checking the owner
    marker, liveness, and harness-specific eligibility and while removing the
    directory. A replacement runner holds the same lock throughout bridge
    preparation, so cleanup either finishes before preparation begins or skips
    the actively prepared directory. The final marker reread remains as a
    conservative guard against uncoordinated marker writers.
    Dirs with no marker (or an unparseable one) are left untouched: they are
    either from an older version or not ours.

    Reuses ``inner/terminal.py:_process_alive`` as the liveness predicate.

        ``~/.omnigent/codex-native``.

    Sweep orphaned bridge dirs across every native harness during maintenance.

    Iterates the registered native coding agents and invokes each one's
    module-level ``prune_orphaned_bridge_dirs`` (if it defines one), so
    adding a new native harness needs no edit here — it participates simply
    by exposing that function. The bridge module name is derived from the
    agent key (``omnigent.harnesses.<key>_native.bridge``). Each harness's prune is
    isolated: an import failure, a missing pruner, or a raising pruner
    never aborts the sweep of the others.

    Mirrors ``inner/terminal.py:reap_orphaned_terminals``; host maintenance and
    standalone runners call this to reclaim dirs leaked by a prior runner that
    died without running the explicit delete path.
