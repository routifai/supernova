"""The owner's monthly model budget as a policy: stop at the limit, or ask to continue.

A thin sibling of :func:`omnigent.policies.builtins.cost.user_daily_cost_budget`, not a mode of
it: that factory is a daily, admin-configured *downgrade gate* with unpriced-model prompts, while
this one is month-based, takes its limits from the person's and the organization's settings
(:mod:`omnigent.model_credentials.budget`) and must not nag about unpriced models. It shares the
mechanics that matter: the owner rollup seed in ``event["context"]["user_daily_cost"]``, the
request/tool-call gates and an ASK whose approval the engine records per owner through a reserved
``state_updates`` key, so it holds across all the owner's sessions.

``at_limit="stop"`` DENYs once spend reaches the limit. ``"ask"`` ASKs at the limit and then
each time spend grows by :data:`ASK_STEP` of the limit. The person's limit and the
organization's are checked, and their approvals remembered for the rest of the month,
independently; a stop beats an ask.
