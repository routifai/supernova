"""Memory-upkeep-run store — persists Phase 3 upkeep run records.

See ``rollover/MEMORY-PLAN.md`` section 4 for the design: one row per
upkeep run; the per-user watermark is derived from the last ``succeeded``
run's ``window_until`` (no separate watermark table), and a ``running`` row
doubles as that user's single-run lease.
