"""Project store — persists first-class, owner-private projects.

A project is a user-defined container that groups sessions and exists
independently of its members (see ``designs/PROJECTS_PRD.md``). This store owns
the ``projects`` table. Session→project membership lives on the conversation's
metadata row (``project_id``) and is managed by the conversation store, not
here.

Projects have no ACL of their own (PRD §9): every method is scoped by
``user_id`` so a caller only ever sees and mutates their own projects.
