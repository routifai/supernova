"""Document text that an older gateway stored inside a person's message.

A message that attaches files is stored as the person's words plus one reference line per file.
Older gateways also stored the files' text, in an ``<attachment_context>`` block after the lines.
That text is document data, not the person speaking, so every reader of a user's message (the
transcript, search, the Memory Profile's evidence, Helper activity titles) cuts it with this one
function. Messages stored today never carry the block: the Computer builds it at turn start.
