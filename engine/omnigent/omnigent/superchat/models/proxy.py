"""Engine-side model proxy: a Computer's model calls are made with its owner's key.

The agent can run shell commands inside its Computer, so any key placed in that Computer's env or
files is readable by it. Instead the Computer's harness points its model base URL at this route and
presents a *credential* that is only the Computer's own launch token (``<host_id>:<token>``, the
same token the host tunnel and :mod:`omnigent.server.routes.host_credentials` use). The route
resolves token -> host -> owner server-side, looks up the owner's sealed key, strips whatever auth
the caller sent, injects the owner's key and streams the provider's answer back. The key never
leaves the engine process.

Route: ``/v1/model/{provider}/{path}``. There is no host id in the path: the base URL is fixed in
the session snapshot before the Computer exists, so the host id travels inside the credential.
``provider`` is an upstream from :mod:`omnigent.superchat.models.upstreams` (base URL and auth
style come from there) and is resolved to the owner's connection for exactly that provider: their
own key first, else the organization's. Auth headers and
bodies are never logged.

Before forwarding, a suspended owner is refused with ``account_suspended`` (HTTP 403; the error
type, not the status, is what harnesses classify on); an owner (or organization) at a monthly
budget set to stop is refused with
``model_budget_exhausted`` (HTTP 402); after it, the call's cost is read from the response as it
streams through (:mod:`omnigent.superchat.models.spend`) and added to the owner's daily rollup.
