"""A live "something changed" signal for one Super Chat's Activity Feed.

The feed itself is derived on read (``derive.py``), so a client that wants it live only
needs to know *when* to read again. This watches the session streams that can change a row
and says ``activities.changed`` whenever one of them starts, steps, settles or is renamed.
The payload carries no content: the client refetches the feed, which stays the one source of
truth.

What is watched stays small however long the history is: the chats a person talks in (the
Super Chat and its Side Chats), whose streams already carry their Helpers' lifecycle
(``session.created``, ``session.child_session.updated``), plus the Helpers that are not
settled yet, for their steps and for the parts they hand on. A Helper's stream is dropped the
moment it settles.
