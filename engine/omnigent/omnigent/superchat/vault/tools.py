"""Built-in tools for the secrets vault. Schema-only: the runner dispatches them.

* ``vault_request_secret`` — ask the person to save a login on a secure form; the value
  never enters the chat. Returns a request id the client renders as a secure-entry card.
* ``vault_fill`` — type one saved value into a field of the Computer's browser. The result only
  says "filled"; the model never sees the value.
