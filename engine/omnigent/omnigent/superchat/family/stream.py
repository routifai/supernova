"""One live stream for a Conversation, its Side Chats and its Helpers.

Events carry ids only; the client refetches what changed:

* ``message.done {chat_id, item_id}``: an assistant message was stored in a family chat
  (``item_id`` is the store id; published where the message is persisted);
* ``turn.done {chat_id, status}``: a turn in a family chat ended (completed, failed,
  incomplete or cancelled); a failed turn's error item is stored before this is sent;
* ``message.delivery {chat_id, item_id}``: a message sent during a turn started or stopped
  waiting behind it; refetch to see it;
* ``chat.reset {chat_id, item_id}``: the chat was cleared (``POST .../reset``); its transcript
  now starts after ``item_id``;
* ``chats.changed {root_id}``: a Side Chat was opened, renamed or archived, or a Helper started;
* ``activities.changed {root_id}``: the Activity Feed may have changed;
* ``session.heartbeat``: sent after ~15s of quiet.

It reuses the Activity Feed watcher (``family/changes.py``) for *which* sessions to follow
and how Helpers come and go, and reads the very same per-session streams through it.
