"""Everything the engine stores per person, and how deleting a person removes it.

``delete_user`` used to remove what it knew about (sessions, Computers, keys, schedules) and left
the rest behind: skills, artifacts and their blobs, publications, memory rows. Every row is keyed
by the person's id (their email), which a returning account reuses, so whatever was left came
back with it, published apps included.

This module makes the delete complete by construction. Every table in the schema is classified
here, and ``tests/superchat/admin/test_user_data.py`` fails when a table is not: a new per-person
table cannot ship without deciding how it is removed.
