"""Tool: open a Side Chat from the Super Chat (Muse's ``chat.create``).

Schema-only — like the browser tools, execution needs the runner's
authenticated server client (fork/create a session, bind a host/runner),
which :class:`~omnigent.tools.base.ToolContext` does not carry. The runner
dispatches it via ``superchat/side_chats/handlers.py``.

    Open a Side Chat branched from the Super Chat.

    from a Sub-agent. Two starting modes:

    - ``with_context``: forks the Super Chat with a seeded summary of the
      current discussion plus its recent turns, for continuing a topic
      without cluttering the Super Chat.
    - ``blank``: a fresh chat with only the Memory Profile, for something
      unrelated to the current discussion.

    Runs on the same host/runner as the Super Chat. Returns a handle with
    the new Side Chat's ``conversation_id``.
