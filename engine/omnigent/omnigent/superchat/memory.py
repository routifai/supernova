"""Memory Profile delivery for ``superside-chat`` (SUPERSIDE-CHAT-PLAN.md S6).

:func:`memory_profile_for` is the one function other slices call for a
user's Memory Profile, already wrapped in the per-turn delimiter block
(``omnigent.memory.service.render_profile_block``): S3 calls it for a new
Sub-agent's first message. The per-turn delivery seam for ordinary turns
lives in ``omnigent/runner/app.py`` (``_apply_memory_profile_block``), which
reaches this same logic over ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/memory/profile``
(``omnigent/server/routes/session_memory.py``) since the runner process may
be out-of-process and has no direct runtime access.

        it, so this never reads a stale or differently-configured global.
