"""Built-in tools for searching and reading the person's files.

Schema-only classes: the runner dispatches each to :mod:`omnigent.superchat.knowledge.handlers`,
which answers from the index in the person's Computer. The surface follows qmd (MIT, via the
pi-qmd extension; see NOTICE): three searches that trade speed for quality, two ways to read a
file whole, one status, plus ``files_read_page`` for the picture of a page.

* ``files_search`` — BM25 keywords. Fast; exact words.
* ``files_vsearch`` — by meaning (vectors). Needs the person's embedding key.
* ``files_query`` — hybrid, then a model reorders the best 20. Best quality.
* ``files_get`` / ``files_multi_get`` — a file's Markdown (page markers kept), size-capped.
* ``files_read_page`` — one page: its image (charts, tables, layout) and its text.
* ``files_status`` — folders, files and whether meaning search is on.
