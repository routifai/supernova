"""Files a Helper saved with ``artifact_save``, carried in its result to the chat that started it.

The runner notes each successful save under the saving session; when a Helper finishes, the wake
notice lists its files (and its own Helpers' files, at any depth) with their artifact ids, so the
Muse shows the real file card instead of guessing by name.
