"""add created_by to agents

Revision ID: ii1a2b3c4d5e
Revises: hi1b2c3d4e5f
Create Date: 2026-09-18 00:00:00.000000

Adds ``created_by`` to the ``agents`` table so agent-code mutations
(``PUT /v1/sessions/{id}/agent`` and the session-scoped MCP-server CRUD
routes) can be restricted to the user who created the agent.

- ``created_by``: nullable ``String(128)`` — the identity of the creating
  user for a session-scoped agent. NULL for template agents (which are
  read-only through those routes), for single-user mode (no identity), and
  for rows created before this migration.

Left nullable with no backfill: pre-existing session-scoped rows keep NULL and
are admin-only to mutate (the owner regains a mutable agent by re-uploading the
bundle, which writes a fresh row stamped with their identity). Template agents
keep NULL permanently and never reach the owner check.
