"""
Provider-agnostic interface for running Omnigent hosts in remote sandboxes.

A *sandbox launcher* wraps one sandbox provider (Databricks Lakebox, Modal,
Daytona, …) behind the small set of transport / lifecycle primitives that the
generic bootstrap flow in :mod:`omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.bootstrap`
composes: provision a sandbox, run commands in it, ship files into it, stream
a PTY-backed process out of it, forward a local port into it, and hold a
foreground process open. Everything provider-specific (CLI bootstrap, SSH
quirks, image contents, pip flags) lives behind a :class:`SandboxLauncher`
implementation; everything provider-agnostic (wheel builds, the in-sandbox
App OAuth dance, host registration) lives in ``bootstrap``.

Injected host config uses the loader's ``OMNIGENT_CONFIG_HOME`` resolution,
atomically replaces its config and ownership-marker files, and removes a
previously injected value only while it remains unchanged by the user.

    Shared by every launcher whose sandboxes boot from that image

    ``--force-reinstall`` is required because the host image bakes
    omnigent at the same ``0.1.0`` version. Without it, pip sees the
    version satisfied and silently skips, leaving the sandbox on the
    baked code while the CLI reports success.

    ``--no-deps`` skips the (already baked) dependency tree, so the
    overlay is just the three local wheels. A local checkout that adds
    a brand-new dependency surfaces as ImportError at runtime until
    the official image rebuilds with it (next main commit) — one-time
    manual pip-install of that package per affected sandbox in the
    meantime.

    matching :func:`omnigent.onboarding.provider_config._config_path`.

    Server-managed replacement semantics: the server OWNS the names/keys it
    injects. Entries recorded in the previous marker are removed first BY NAME,
    then the current payload merges in with
    ``omnigent.cli._save_global_config``'s
    ``deep_merge_keys=("providers",)`` semantics — ``providers`` one
    level deep and every other top-level key wholesale. Removing by name (rather
    than only when unchanged) is deliberate: a renamed gateway must not leave
    its old entry behind, since two entries claiming the same ``default`` scope
    is a sandbox load error. User-created config under names the server never
    injects is never in the marker and so always survives; a name the server
    injects is server-managed, and an in-sandbox edit to it does not persist
    across the next replacement. An empty *host_config* renders a pure cleanup
    command. A missing or corrupt marker skips removal rather than guessing
    ownership. Shared by both launch seams — the exec-model

    Wrap a host launch in a restart loop so a crash does not strand the sandbox.

    The sandbox container outlives the host process: PID 1 is a placeholder
    (``sleep infinity``) or the provider's own init, so a dead host leaves a
    healthy, still-billing sandbox with nothing running in it. The only recovery
    is the server re-provisioning a fresh sandbox on the next message, which
    discards the workspace — restarting in place keeps the clone and the
    installed dependencies.

    The loop stands down on a clean exit, on
    :data:`~omnigent.host.HOST_FATAL_EXIT_CODE` (a credential / version failure
    that can never succeed), and on SIGTERM (a deliberate stop). Anything else
    is a crash, retried with a doubling delay. A signal-kill of the host alone
    (SIGKILL → 137) counts as a crash on purpose: that is what an OOM kill looks
    like, and restarting is the wanted response.

    A path that means to STOP the host must therefore signal the supervisor too,
    not just the host — otherwise the loop faithfully restarts it. Both in-sandbox
    stop paths already do: ``foreground_kill_command`` signals the process the
    pidfile recorded (the supervisor, which is what ``exec``s under it), and
    islo's preserved-daemon stop matches ``"omnigent host"`` against full argv,
    which the supervisor's own ``sh -c <script>`` argv contains.

    The attempt counter in the restart log makes a persistently-crashing host
    observable — the loop never gives up, so a wedged box would otherwise be
    silent apart from indistinguishable repeats.

    When *host_id* is given, the loop records its OWN pid (stable across
    restart attempts — it is the supervising shell, not the host process) at
    :func:`supervised_host_pidfile_path`, written before the first attempt so
    a sandbox whose provider persists across launches (a relaunch onto a
    still-live sandbox, or Nova's ``computer`` provider, which never
    terminates — see :mod:`omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.computer`) can detect
    an already-running loop for the same host id and skip starting a second
