# Runtime data directory layout

Omnigent keeps all machine-local state in a single **runtime data directory**,
`~/.omnigent` by default. This is where the runtime database, logs,
credentials, per-harness session state, and process registries live.

The root is resolved by `data_dir()` in `omnigent/process_logging.py`:

```python
def data_dir() -> Path:
    value = os.environ.get("OMNIGENT_DATA_DIR")
    return Path(value).expanduser() if value else Path.home() / ".omnigent"
```

Set `OMNIGENT_DATA_DIR` to relocate the whole tree — tests and sandboxed runs
use this so they never touch your real `~/.omnigent`. Config resolution is
separate: `OMNIGENT_CONFIG_HOME` overrides where `config.yaml` is read from
(see `omnigent/config.py`).

Two related resolvers exist for narrower scopes:

- The server resolves its operator-editable state via
  `resolve_data_dir()` in `omnigent/server/admin_list.py`. It honors
  `OMNIGENT_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_PATH` (its parent dir anchors the data dir on a
  mounted volume) and otherwise falls back to `~/.omnigent`.
- CLI and local-server flows resolve their data dir via `_local_data_dir()` in
  `omnigent/host/local_server.py` (imported by `omnigent/cli.py`), which also
  honors `OMNIGENT_DATA_DIR`, else `~/.omnigent`. Two worktrees still share
  `~/.omnigent/chat.db` unless each sets `OMNIGENT_DATA_DIR` — that env var is
  the knob for isolating a worktree's runtime DB; there is no automatic split.

Most paths below move with `OMNIGENT_DATA_DIR`. A handful, marked **†**, are
pinned to `~/.omnigent` regardless — they resolve `Path.home() / ".omnigent"`
directly instead of going through `data_dir()`.

## Top-level files

| Path | Purpose | Defined in |
|------|---------|------------|
| `config.yaml` | User-level config: harness auth references, settings. Overridable with `OMNIGENT_CONFIG_HOME`. | `omnigent/config.py` |
| `chat.db` (+ `-shm`, `-wal`) | Main SQLite runtime DB — conversations, sessions, messages. Machine-global unless a project-local `.omnigent/` is used. | `omnigent/cli.py`, `omnigent/host/local_server.py` |
| `auth_tokens.json` / `auth_tokens.lock` | Per-server OIDC/session tokens keyed by server URL, written with user-only permissions, plus its lock file (`.json` is replaced by `.lock`, so it is `auth_tokens.lock`, not `auth_tokens.json.lock`). | `omnigent/cli_auth.py` |
| `local_server.pid` / `local_server.sig` | Recorded pid/port and signature of the running local server. | `omnigent/host/local_server.py` |
| `host.pid` | Recorded pid of the local host process. | `omnigent/cli.py` |
| `telemetry.json` | Telemetry state, including the persistent `installation_id`. | `omnigent/telemetry/installation_id.py` |
| `.update_check.json` **†** | Cached result of the (potentially slow) update check. | `omnigent/update_check.py` |
| `install_ledger.json` | Record of what the installer wrote, used by uninstall/purge. | `omnigent/install_ledger.py` |
| `admins`, `allowed_domains` | OSS server operator state: admin list and OIDC allowed-domains, co-located so operator-editable files live together. Operator-managed input files — the cited modules read them. A listed identity is promoted to the database admin flag on login (OIDC, accounts) or on first page load (header auth); removing it from `admins` does not revoke that flag, which must be cleared separately. | Read by `omnigent/server/admin_list.py`, `omnigent/server/oidc_access.py` |
| `sharing_mode`, `public_sharing`, `default_public_sessions` | Server-side sharing settings, written from Settings > Sharing. Each overrides its boot default: `OMNIGENT_SHARING_MODE`, `OMNIGENT_PUBLIC_SHARING` and `OMNIGENT_DEFAULT_PUBLIC_SESSIONS` (`off` / `sandbox` / `all`, which new sessions start with public read access). | `omnigent/server/sharing_settings.py` |

## Directories

| Directory | Purpose | Defined in |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| `logs/` | Process logs split by role: `cli/`, `host/`, `runner/`, `server/`. | `logs_root()` / `process_log_dir()` in `omnigent/process_logging.py` |
| `artifacts/` | Stored artifacts, one directory per artifact ID; paired with `chat.db`. | `omnigent/chat.py`, `omnigent/host/local_server.py` |
| `attachments/` | Native harness attachment copies, grouped by an opaque session cache key. The original uploads remain in the server's configured artifact store. | `attachment_cache_dir()` in `omnigent/inner/native_attachments.py` |
| `runners/` | Runner identity: `runner_id` (stable per-machine id), created by `identity.py`. Also holds per-runner workspace subdirs — `runner_<id>/` and, for token-bound remote `run --server` runners, `runner_token_<hash>/` — each with a `pending-tokens/` dir; those are created by the host/runner launch path, not `identity.py`. | `omnigent/runner/identity.py` (`runner_id`) |
| `daemons/` | Daemon lifecycle registry, one JSON record per target. | `daemon_registry_dir()` in `omnigent/host/daemon_lifecycle.py` |
| `crashes/` | Crash reports, `crash-<timestamp>.md`. | `omnigent/crash_handler.py` |
| `cache/` | Derived caches: `model-catalogs/` (per-harness model lists) and `codex-model-probe/` **†**. | `omnigent/models/model_catalog_store.py`, `omnigent/harnesses/codex_native/app_server.py` |
| `models/` **†** | Downloaded models, e.g. `dictation/asr` and `dictation/punct`. | `omnigent/server/dictation.py` |
| `agents/` **†** | User-level agent directory (`_GLOBAL_AGENTS_DIR`). | `omnigent/cli.py` |
| `profiles/` | cProfile output when CLI profiling is enabled. | `omnigent/cli.py` |
| `debug/` **†** | Per-session JSONL event tapes, `events-<session_id>.jsonl`. | `omnigent/repl/_event_tape.py` |

### Agent cache staging and recovery

The server CLI places the extracted agent cache at `<artifact_dir>/.cache/`;
`AgentCache` can also be constructed with another cache root. Each published
bundle lives at `<cache_root>/<agent_id>/`. The reserved `.staging/` directory
holds private `bundle-*` extractions and `backup-*/previous` directories used
while replacing a bundle. These stay on the cache filesystem for `rename()`.

Normal operations remove their scratch directories. If replacement and rollback
both fail, the exception names the retained backup and the memory cache is
invalidated so a later load can retry from the ArtifactStore. Cleanup errors
emit a warning with the directory path instead of hiding the failure or
changing the outcome of publication. A process crash can also leave scratch
files without a warning.

Retained backups and crash remnants are **not automatically reaped**. Monitor
`.staging` disk usage, especially after storage or permission failures. To
clean it up:

1. Stop every process using that cache root, including any other server sharing
   the volume. Age alone does not establish that a staging directory is unused.
2. Inspect the named backups and keep anything needed for recovery. Confirm the
   required agent bundles are available in the configured ArtifactStore.
3. Remove only the reviewed `bundle-*` and `backup-*` entries in `.staging`,
   repair disk-space or permission problems, and restart the server. Future
   cache misses re-extract bundles from the ArtifactStore.

### Attached files

Claude Code and Codex accept ZIP archives, Office documents (`.docx`, `.xlsx`,
`.pptx`), and SQLite files (`.db`, `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3`). The composer shows
ordinary file cards with an icon, filename, type, and size; images keep their
thumbnail and preview. There is no attachment storage selector or workspace
badge.

The server keeps the original upload in its configured artifact store and a
session-owned file record referenced by `file_id`. The runner materializes
files needed by native harnesses under
`~/.omnigent/attachments/<session-key>/<filename>`, or
`$OMNIGENT_DATA_DIR/attachments/<session-key>/<filename>` when overridden. This
path is on the execution host, which may differ from the server or browser's
machine. The harness receives an absolute path. Attaching a file adds no file,
directory, or symlink to the working checkout, and archives are not extracted.

The cache key derives from the session's native bridge path. Claude Code and
Codex can recreate copies from the artifact store when rebuilding session
history. Native session cleanup removes the corresponding cache; the cache
is not the durable copy of an upload. Other native harnesses use the same
cache for their existing supported attachment types.

Custom sandbox and provider configurations must allow the runner to write
this cache and the harness's file-reading tools to read the emitted absolute
path. Permission to read the working directory, or an older bridge-local
`uploads/` directory, does not grant access to `attachments/`. If the harness
uses a separate filesystem namespace, expose the session cache at the same
absolute path. Scope any added access to the required cache, rather than the
whole data directory, which also contains credentials. Runtime capability
checks require an updated host/runner; they do not change sandbox access.

See [attachment admission controls](POLICIES.md#attachment-admission-controls)
for filename-based limits and their scope.

### Native harness state

Some native (TUI) harnesses keep resumable session state under `~/.omnigent`:
`claude-native/`, `codex-native/`, `opencode-native/` (all via `data_dir()`),
and `pi-native/` **†** and `antigravity-native/` **†** (pinned to
`~/.omnigent`).

Within each, session state lives in a subdirectory named by a digest of the
conversation id (a leading `conv_` is normalized before hashing, and a legacy
prefixed digest is used when one is already present), holding e.g.
`launch.json` — how that native session was launched, so it can be resumed. See
`omnigent/harnesses/claude_native/state.py` and
`omnigent/harnesses/codex_native/state.py`.

`codex-native/` additionally holds `process-registry.json` (+ `.lock`) and
`process-owners/`, tracking spawned CLI processes
(`omnigent/harnesses/codex_native/process_registry.py`).

Not every native harness lives here: `qwen-native`, `hermes-native`, and
`cursor-native` root their per-session bridge dirs in the system temp
directory (`$TMPDIR/omnigent-<uid>/<harness>-native/`), so they are outside the
data dir. See e.g. `omnigent/harnesses/qwen_native/bridge.py`.

## Notes

- The canonical source of truth is the code, not this document. Start at
  `data_dir()` in `omnigent/process_logging.py` and follow its callers; each
  subsystem documents its own path in a docstring.
- An existing `~/.omnigent` may also contain files this document doesn't list:
  backups you created by hand (e.g. `chat.db.bak*`, `chat1.db`) and leftovers
  from older versions (e.g. `server.yaml`, `node-ca-bundle.pem`) that the
  current code no longer writes.
- To remove this state, `omnigent uninstall --purge` handles the tree; see
  `docs/UNINSTALL_DESIGN.md`.
