# The `devin-native` harness

`omnigent devin` wraps the resident **Devin CLI** TUI (Cognition) in a
runner-owned tmux pane and mirrors it into an Omnigent conversation.

It **replaces** Devin's built-in ACP harness. That row (`devin-acp`, and the
`omnigent.inner.devin` dialect behind it) was **removed in 0.14**: the id is
aliased onto `devin-native`, so a session, bundle or `--harness devin-acp`
script that still names it resolves onto the native wrap instead of failing.
Nothing that worked is lost — the ACP path never warm-resumed (`COLD_ONLY`, no
`session/load`). A **user-configured** `acp:devin` is untouched: it
canonicalizes to `acp` and runs the generic executor from the user's own config.

| Harness id | What it is | Notable |
|---|---|---|
| `devin-native` | This wrap: the real Devin TUI in a tmux pane, mirrored into Chat | Policy enforcement, approval cards, model + effort, resume, cost, sub-agents as child sessions |
| `devin-acp` (removed 0.14) | was `devin acp` through the generic ACP executor | Id aliased onto `devin-native` so old references still resolve |

The bare spelling `devin` canonicalizes to `devin-native` (as `opencode` does to
`opencode-native`), so `--harness devin` and `omnigent devin` both land on the
native wrap; the ACP path keeps its own id, `--harness devin-acp`. A
user-configured `acp:devin` agent is unaffected. Known break (accepted): a
session persisted before this cutover with harness `devin` (which meant ACP
then) resumes on the native wrap, not ACP.

Omnigent stores no Devin credential — the CLI writes its own credential file and
reads it back at spawn. `devin auth status` is a real probe (exit 0 only while
logged in), so `omni setup` reports the live auth state rather than guessing.

## Why hooks, not screen-scraping

Devin exposes a lifecycle-hook system whose payloads are close to Claude Code's
(`hook_event_name`, `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `prompt`) and add two ids the other
native harnesses have to reconstruct:

| Field | What it gives us |
|---|---|
| `prompt_id` | The turn id — used directly as the Omnigent `response_id` |
| `tool_use_id` | Pairs `PreToolUse` with its `PostToolUse`, so tool cards match their output with no ordering heuristic |
| `last_assistant_message` (on `Stop`) | The assistant bubble, with no transcript parsing |

So the mirror is hook-driven. Three channels meet in a per-session **bridge
directory** (`omnigent/devin_native_bridge.py`):

                                POST /v1/sessions/{id}/events
```

`--export` also writes an **ATIF** transcript after every turn. Hooks carry no
reasoning text or token counts, so the forwarder reads those from the export on
each turn-end edge (`reasoning_content` per agent step, `final_metrics` for
cumulative tokens → `external_session_usage`).

## Hooks are registered without touching your repo

Devin reads hooks from its user config, and `--config <path>` overrides where
that config lives. Rather than writing `.devin/hooks.v1.json` into the user's
checkout (a tracked file), `write_devin_session_config()` merges the user's own
`~/.config/devin/config.json` with an Omnigent `hooks` block into a
session-scoped file inside the bridge dir. The user's theme, permissions and MCP
preferences survive, the repo stays clean, and the hooks die with the session.
Project-level `.devin/config.json` still applies on top, because `--config`
replaces only the *user* config.

## Policy and approvals

Two independent gates, matching `claude-native`:

* **Omnigent policy** — `UserPromptSubmit` (request), `PreToolUse` (tool call)
  and `PostToolUse` (tool result) POST to
  `/v1/sessions/{id}/policies/evaluate`. The shared
  `omnigent/native_policy_hook.py` seam owns the translation, including
  fail-closed defaults, so Devin behaves exactly like claude-native and
  codex-native here. An ASK verdict is resolved server-side (the POST parks
  until a human answers) and returns a hard ALLOW/DENY.
* **Devin's own consent prompt** — `PermissionRequest` is republished as an
  Omnigent elicitation, so the approval card renders in Chat instead of being
  stranded in a pane nobody is watching. A timeout or unreachable server emits
  nothing, which Devin reads as "no opinion" and falls back to its own TUI
  prompt (fail-ask).

Verified against devin 3000.10.21: a `PreToolUse` hook returning
`hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision: "deny"` blocks the tool **even under
`--permission-mode bypass`**, and the reason reaches the model. Devin's only
divergence from Claude Code's payload shape is `PostToolUse`, which carries
`tool_response` (`{success, output, error}`) where Claude sends `tool_output`;
the hook normalizes that before calling the shared seam.

## Model and effort

Devin has **no `--effort` flag**: effort is a suffix on the model id
(`claude-opus-5-xhigh`). Omnigent keeps model and effort as separate axes and
recombines them at launch via `resolve_devin_launch_model()`, which validates the
pair against `devin models list --format json`. A family with no such rung (e.g.
`gemini-3.8-flash` has no `max`) falls back to the bare family slug, which Devin
resolves to its own default variant — so a mismatched pair costs effort, not the
session.

    omnigent devin --model opus --effort xhigh     # -> --model claude-opus-5-xhigh
    omnigent devin --model gemini --effort max     # -> --model gemini-3.8-flash

The picker lists model *families* (48 of them) rather than the ~400 raw variants,
with each family's real effort rungs attached. The same composition runs for a
New Chat pick, because the runner reads `model_override` + `reasoning_effort` off
the session snapshot and composes there too.

In-session switching works through `/model` (the executor types it before the
message when a routed model changes).

## Interrupt

Devin's own hint reads "esc twice to interrupt": a single `Escape` only clears
the composer draft. `inject_interrupt()` sends two, spaced apart, which yields
`✱ Canceled.` and returns the composer to its idle placeholder.

## Steering

Devin's composer stays writable while a turn runs — its placeholder changes from
`Ask Devin to build features…` to `Guide Devin while it works` — so a queued
web-UI message steers the running turn rather than waiting for it. That is why
the executor declares `supports_live_message_queue()`.

## Known gaps

* **Sub-agent children arrive on completion, not at spawn.** A `run_subagent`
  delegate is mirrored as a child session only once it finishes: Devin persists
  the delegate's chain in its own session store and injects a
  `<subagent_completion_notification>` into the parent, which is the point the
  chain is complete and stable. So there is no live child view while a delegate
  runs. Delegates launched with the *same* task text are told apart by the final
  report that notification quotes (`chain_index_for_report`), since a delegate's
  own chain carries no `agent_id`.
* **Permission mode has two channels.** The New Chat dialog pins Devin's own
  rungs (normal / accept-edits / smart / dangerous) as `terminal_launch_args`,
  because the create-time `permission_mode` *field* is still hard-gated to
  `claude-native` (`_PERMISSION_MODE_HARNESS` in
  `server/routes/_session_create_validation.py`). Mid-session, the composer
  control cycles the mode in the TUI (`inject_permission_mode` presses Shift+Tab
  and re-reads the composer marker), so the stored mode is always the one the
  pane confirmed.
* **A `!` shell command typed in the pane is invisible to Chat.** Devin's bang
  prefix is a TUI-local shell escape: it fires no hook, writes no `message_nodes`
  entry, and never reaches the ATIF export, so there is no channel to mirror it
  from (claude-native can only do this because Claude Code writes `<bash-input>` /
  `<bash-stdout>` records into the transcript the forwarder tails). Sending the
  same `!cmd` from the web composer *does* appear, because the injected paste
  bypasses Devin's bang interception: Devin takes it as a message and the agent
  runs it as an `exec` tool call — governed by policy, with a tool card — rather
  than as a local shell.
* **Token-level streaming.** The forwarder mirrors whole hook events, so it posts
  no `external_output_text_delta`; `capabilities.streaming` is `False` by
  construction. The embedded terminal still shows Devin's own live output.
